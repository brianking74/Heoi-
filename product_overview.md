# Heoi! (去) - Product Overview

**Heoi!** is a hyper-local, AI-first social discovery platform designed for the modern explorer in Hong Kong. It moves away from the sterile, star-rating system of TripAdvisor and the "dating fatigue" of social apps, focusing on "Micro-Experiences" and meaningful casual connections.

## 1. Brand & Aesthetic
- **Visuals:** High-contrast White and Hong Kong Red (`#de2810`). 
- **Icons:** Minimalist Lantern motifs replace traditional icons.
- **Vibe:** "Artory / Museum" aesthetic—clean, bold, premium, yet culturally rooted.

## 2. Core Social Strategy (Casual Friending)
- **Interest-First Discovery:** Users match based on shared vibes (e.g., "Coffee Vibes", "Hidden Nature").
- **Profiles:** Large, high-quality imagery focused on lifestyle and personality rather than dating tropes.
- **Connection Logic:** Anyone can "Connect" (a public request to be friends), but deeper engagement (Chat) is a premium feature to ensure community quality and filter out spam/creeps.

## 3. Premium Monetization (Elite 852)
The app operates on a "Freemium" model with a strong focus on high-value social and planning features:

### Free Tier
- Browse all Micro-Experiences.
- 1 AI-generated route per day.
- View fellow explorer profiles and send connection requests.

### Premium (Elite 852) - Visitor Pass & Annual Membership
- **Unlimited Messaging:** Start chats with any "Open to Meet" explorer.
- **Unlimited AI Planning:** Use Gemini to plan your entire stay without limits.
- **Vibe Filtering:** Advanced filters for people and places.
- **Elite Status:** Badge on profile and priority in discovery feeds.

**Pricing Model:**
1. **Visitor Pass ($78 HKD / 7 Days):** Tailored for travelers who need short-term chat and planning access.
2. **Annual Legend ($488 HKD / Year):** Best for locals and expats building a social circle in HK.

## 4. Safety & Trust
- **Group Hangouts:** Suggested as primary meeting contexts to reduce "first-date" pressure.
- **Spam Filtering:** Paywall for chat acts as a natural barrier against low-effort spam.
- **Verified Status:** Integrated with local identity checks for "Legends".
